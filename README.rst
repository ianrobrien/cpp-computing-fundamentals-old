Computing Fundamentals in C++ |Build Status|
==============================================================================================================================================================================================

Requirements for project:
1. Works with ReSharper (limits project to either CMake or VSCS but VS2017 ReSharper and CMake support is very poor right now)
2. Is compatible with a Visual Studio build service (limits test framework to VSTest since the only (free) option is Team Services)

Therefore, this project is created with Visual Studio, integration tested on Team Services, and uses the VSTest framework. A very Microsoft project.
